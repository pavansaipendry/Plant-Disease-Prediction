## Project Details

In this project, I developed a plant disease prediction model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to classify different plant diseases from images, which can assist in early diagnosis and treatment in agriculture.

### Steps Undertaken

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collected a dataset of plant images with labels indicating various disease types.
   - Preprocessed the images by resizing them to a consistent shape and applying normalization to improve model performance.
   - Augmented the data to increase model robustness by creating variations of the existing images (e.g., rotations, flips).

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to process the images.
   - The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
   - Added fully connected layers for classification, with a softmax activation function in the output layer for multi-class prediction.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the model's generalization.
   - Trained the CNN model using categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer.
   - Used accuracy as the primary evaluation metric and tracked training and validation accuracy/loss to monitor the model’s performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated the model on the test dataset to assess its performance.
   - Analyzed metrics such as accuracy and loss on the test set, and used confusion matrices to visualize the model’s performance across different classes.
   - Saved the trained model for deployment purposes.

5. **Deployment with Streamlit**
   - Designed a simple interface using Streamlit to allow users to upload images and get real-time predictions on plant disease types.
   - The deployed application takes an input image, preprocesses it, and feeds it to the trained model, displaying the prediction to the user.

6. **Documentation and Code Organization**
   - Documented the code for each step, making it easy to understand and modify in the future.
   - Structured the project files and created a `README.md` to guide users on how to run and use the project.

### Key Accomplishments

- Successfully built and trained a CNN model with satisfactory accuracy for plant disease prediction.
- Created an interactive interface for model inference using Streamlit, making the project accessible for real-world applications.
- Organized the project files and documentation for ease of use and future enhancement.
